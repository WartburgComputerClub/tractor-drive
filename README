TractorDrive is a Blender project that aims to 
create 3D representations of Grant Wood paintings that can
be explored by driving a tractor through them.  Created for
the Waterloo Center for the Arts, this project wishes to provide
users with an interactive experience of artwork by a famous Iowan
artist.
